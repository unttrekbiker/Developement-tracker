# Developement-tracker

This is intended to be a employee development tracker.
As each employee completes various training courses, the tracker will show the total progress made towards each position/role.  
Ideally, an employee can view their total progress when working towards a promotion.
Employees that have 100% completion will then slow as being eligible for potential promotions.
